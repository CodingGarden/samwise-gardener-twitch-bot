# Samwise Gardener Twitch Bot

Forked from the [twitch team shoutout bot], this bot contains coding garden specific commands.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js version 12.0.0 or higher is required. This bot was tested against Node.js version 14.0.0
  * [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) can be used to install / manage Node.js versions

### Setup

Install dependencies:

```sh
npm i
```

### Environment Config

Copy the `.env.sample` file into a file named `.env` and update the variables accordingly.

```sh
cp .env.sample .env
```

Variable | Description
--- | ---
BOT_USERNAME | The twitch username of the bot that will be used to send the messages.
TWITCH_OAUTH_TOKEN | Twitch OAuth token for the given BOT_USERNAME - can be obtained here: https://twitchapps.com/tmi/
TWITCH_CLIENT_ID | Twitch Client ID used to generate the above token, if using the above service to generate a token, use this Client ID: `q6batx0epp608isickayubi39itsckt`
CHANNEL_NAME | The twitch channel name to send the messages in.
CHANNEL_ID | The channel ID of the above CHANNEL_NAME, used to prevent shouting out yourself.
TEAM_NAME | The name of the team! Must match the team named used by twitch i.e. the one in the team page url e.g. `https://www.twitch.tv/team/livecoders` is `livecoders`

### Messaging Config

The `src/config.js` file contains the timeout in milliseconds to wait between shoutouts for the same team member and also includes a `getMessage` function that is used to format the message to be sent when a team member is detected. Both of these values can be updated directly in the file.

### Running

After installing dependencies, creating the `.env` file and updating the `src/config.js` file, run the bot:

```sh
npm start
```
